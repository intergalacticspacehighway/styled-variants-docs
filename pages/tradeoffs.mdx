# Tradeoffs

- As of now, Styled variants is a build time only library. It has very little runtime for theme context and responsive/interaction style utils. [createVariant](https://github.com/intergalacticspacehighway/react-native-styled-variants/blob/main/src/index.tsx#L259) is actually a noop function!

<br />

This adds some tradeoffs for runtime resolution.

<br />

## This won't work

```jsx
const style = {
  padding: "$space.10",
};

const App = () => {
  return <View sx={style} />;
};
```

- `sx` prop is resolved and converted to stylesheet or style object during build time.

### Change above to below

```jsx
const App = () => {
  return <View sx={{ padding: "$space.10" }} />;
};
```

However, there is an escape hatch if you want to use theme tokens in a variable.

### useTheme hook

- [createTheme](/create-theme) returns with a hook named `useTheme`. This hook can be used to access the theme object.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  const themeSpaceToken = theme.space["10"];
  return <View style={{ padding: themeSpaceToken }} />;
};
```

## This won't work

```jsx
const a = <Text sx={{ color: "$colors.blue" }} />;
```

- **sx prop can only be used inside a component**

### Change above to below

```jsx
const A = () => {
  return <Text sx={{ color: "$colors.blue" }} />;
};
```
